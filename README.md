# FleetSegmentation
This is an R-package created for the segmentation of fishing fleets. It contains a standardized, fishery-based approach to fleet segmentation based on multivariate statistics. It was created and is maintained by Erik Sulanke for the Th√ºnen Insitute of Sea Fisheries in Bremerhaven, Germany. To install the package, you will need the most recent version of R (at least 4.1.1) and R Studio (at least 1.4.1717), a recent version of Rtools (rtools40), and the most recent version of the devtools-package (at least 2.4.2). 
The best way to install the FleetSegmentation package is by running:
library(devtools)
and then
install_github("ESulanke/FleetSegmentation", build_manual = T, build_vignettes = T)
From your console. If you have all the prerequisites set and the installation still doesn't work, don't hesitate to contact me via erik.sulanke@thuenen.de so we can find a way to fix this.

All the best, 
Erik
